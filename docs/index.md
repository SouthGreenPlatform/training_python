Python is a general-purpose programming language used in disparate fields and is becoming more and more popular for data science.

## Course content and learning outcomes

Introduction to programming using the Python language. At the end of this training participants will be able to write programs in Python and manipulate biological data and understand more complex programs written by others.


The following points will be covered:
Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
Data typing
Control structures (conditions and loops)
Functions
Writing rules
Practical application of writing and executing programs
Management of options and creation/edition of files
Regular expressions
Reading/writing bioinformatics files (csv, fasta, sam...)
BONUS:

Introduction to Pandas

## Application

This is an {{config.extra.institute}} course. The course is open for PhD students, postdocs,
group leaders and core facility staff related to the {{config.extra.institute}} Platform (IRD,
CIRAD, INRAE and the Alliance Bioversity international-CIAT).

If we receive more applications than we can accommodate, participants will be selected based on several
criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to
attend the course. We also take in consideration a balance between the different
institute and department.

Please note that {{config.extra.institute}} training events do not provide any formal university
credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of
credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits
are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before
submitting a course application in order to establish whether the course is
valid for formal credits or not.

## Prerequisites:

The course is aimed at complete beginners and assumes no prior programming experience.

By accepting to participate in the course, you agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](course-information/code-of-conduct.md).
